    <h1>EXAMPLE</h1>

    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>Molly had been staring out of her <b> window</b> for about
        an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies
        of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all
        the other scientific journals her work had
        appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On
            The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book
        since college, and the longer she spent in these
        four walls the more she felt she needed to be
        free.</p>
    <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room,
        sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote
        proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of
            people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although
        many considered her pioneering work, unraveling
        the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an
        outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think
        she had something better to do.</p>
